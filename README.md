# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description
This application is designed to be a Progressive Web Application text-editor. The application is designed to run within the user's terminal using Node JavaScript. Once initialized the user will be able to create notes or code snippets without an internet connection. The user will also be able to download the application to their computer where they can continue their work offline. The text editor utilizes the webpack configuration, manifest, and asset caching. I was inspired to build this project to give developers the ability to create and view notes or code snippets, even when offline. 

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "employee-tracker-cms" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment
7. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm i
```
8. Next run the following command to initialize the application:
```
npm start
```

## Usage 
You may use this to create notes and snippets of code to view them for future use. Simply add the note or line of code on the lines below the JATE logo. You can also download the application to your computer by clicking the install button in the top left of the screen.
